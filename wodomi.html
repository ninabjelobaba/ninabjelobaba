<p class="end"><strong>And for the end</strong></p>

<p class="end"><em>After a few years of working in big companies, I figured out, I need change. <br>
   I need a more challenging job, something that will inspire me, make me satisfied <br>
   and in the same time what is valuable. My experience seems humble <br>
  (regarding the certain IT background) but I am constantly working on it,<br>
   and more importantly, I would be thrilled to prove you that.</em></p>
